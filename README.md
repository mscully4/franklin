# Franklin

![Franklin](Franklin.jpg)

Franklin is a personal autonomous agent that monitors Gmail and your calendar — surfacing what needs attention and acting on it. DM him on Telegram, and he figures out how to get it done.

---

## How It Works

Tasks are called **quests**. The flow is:

1. DM Franklin or @mention him in a channel
2. Franklin creates a quest, DMs you a proposed approach
3. You approve, give feedback, or cancel
4. Franklin executes and reports back

For simple requests (send an email, check a dashboard, answer a question), Franklin just does it — no quest needed.

## Architecture

```
franklin.ts (supervisor, 30-second cycles)
  ├── server.ts (dashboard + Telegram bot listener)
  ├── Scouts (gmail, calendar)
  ├── filter-signals (dedup + state comparison)
  ├── Brain (reads signals, decides what to do)
  ├── Workers (autonomous Claude agents)
  └── Quest agents (long-running multi-step tasks)
```

**Scouts** poll external sources on staggered intervals and write results to `state/scout_results/`.

**filter-signals** compares current state against previously surfaced state in SQLite, passing through only what changed.

**Brain** reads the filtered signals and writes `state/delegation.json` — a list of tasks to execute.

**Workers** are autonomous Claude agents that receive a task and figure out how to do it. They have access to MCP tools, a global skills library (`~/DevEnv/skills/`), and playbooks for complex workflows.

**Quest agents** handle multi-step work that spans multiple steps and tool calls.

## Scouts

| Scout | Interval | What it monitors |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| `gmail` | 15 min | Unread inbox (filters out automated noise) |
| `calendar` | 10 min | Today + tomorrow events, transcript availability |

---

## Workers

Workers are autonomous — given a task, they decide how to execute it. They can:

- Use MCP tools directly
- Invoke skills from `~/DevEnv/skills/`
- Follow playbooks from `playbooks/`
- Ask you for clarification via Slack DM
- Update Franklin's own prompts and config based on your feedback

See `modes/worker_wrapper.md` for the full worker prompt.

---

## Scheduled Tasks

Recurring jobs defined in `state/scheduled_tasks.json`. The supervisor fires them on schedule — no brain involved. Tasks come in two kinds:

**Worker tasks** (default) — spawn a Claude worker with LLM reasoning:

```json
{
  "id": "daily-review",
  "every": "weekdays",
  "type": "scheduled",
  "priority": "normal",
  "context": { "objective": "Run daily service health review" }
}
```

**Script tasks** — run a shell command directly, no LLM:

```json
{
  "id": "sandbox-cleanup",
  "every": "daily",
  "type": "scheduled",
  "priority": "low",
  "kind": "script",
  "command": "npx tsx src/actions/cleanup-sandboxes.ts",
  "timeout": 30000,
  "context": { "objective": "Clean up stale quest sandbox directories" }
}
```

Use `kind: "script"` for deterministic tasks that don't need reasoning (cleanup, pruning, health pings). Script-specific fields: `command` (required), `timeout` in ms (optional, default 60s).

Valid frequencies: `"30m"`, `"4h"`, `"7d"`, `"2w"`, `"daily"`, `"weekdays"`, `"weekly"`

You can also DM Franklin to add/remove scheduled tasks.

## Dashboard

`http://localhost:7070` — auto-starts with Franklin.

Shows: process health, socket status, scout intervals, active workers, quests, dispatch history, today's meetings, scheduled tasks.

---

## Quests

Each quest is tracked in SQLite and as a JSON file in `state/quests/`. Franklin tracks:

- Objective and approach
- Every action taken (log)
- Outcome when complete

---

## Self-Improvement

Franklin updates his own prompts and config based on your feedback. Tell him "always do X" or "stop doing Y" and he'll edit the relevant file (`CLAUDE.md`, `modes/brain.md`, `modes/worker_wrapper.md`, etc.) and confirm what changed. Changes are logged in `state/self_improvement_log.json`.

## Setup

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for the full setup guide.

Quick start:

```bash
npm install
cp state/settings.example.json state/settings.json
# Edit settings.json with your info
# Add Slack tokens to secrets/
npx tsx franklin.ts
```

Key `state/settings.json` fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `owner_user_id` | Your Slack user ID |
| `timezone` | Your timezone (e.g. `America/Chicago`) |
| `feature_flags.skip_docker` | `true` to skip Docker startup globally — workers push to CI instead |
